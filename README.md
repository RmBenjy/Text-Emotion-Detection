# Text Emotion Detection
A machine learning project with an interactive application that runs our trained machine learning model and give output according to the user input. 
It follows the complete lifecycle of a machine learning model. Below are the steps that you need to follow while creating an end to end application for your model:

1. Data access and collection
2. Data preparation and exploration
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Model deployment

I will be using the streamlit framework in python to create a web interface for interacting with the machine learning model.
